given a sorted arr, bianry search always start at
mid element, according to interpolation search, 
it will choose pos which is closer to the key,
start at starting or ending. It need to follow the
formula:
pos = lo + ((x-arr[lo])*(hi-lo))/(arr[hi]-arr(lo)) (a)

explain:
assume: y is value and x is its index
X: 0 1 2 3 4 5
y: 2 5 6 7 9 10
general equation of line: y = ax + b
now putting value lo, hi and x in the equation
arr[hi] = a.hi+b  (1)
arr[lo] = a.lo+b  (2)
x  		= a.pos+b (3)

(1) - (2) = m = (arr[hi] - arr[lo])/(hi - lo)
(2) - (3) = x - arr[lo] = m*(pos - lo)
<=> pos = lo + (x - arr[lo])/mid
<=> pos = (a)

process:
s1: in loop, calculate the value of 'pos' using 
the formula

s2: if it is a match, return the index for item

s3: less than arr[pos], calculate the probe 
position of the left sub-arr. Otherwise, calculate 
the same in the right sub-arr

s4: repeat intil a match is fond or the sub-arr
reduces to 0
