use for sorted arr, arr with n elements, choose
the step (m) to jump, and when jump to km with 
larger than key, use linear search to find element
between (k-1)m and km

arr: 1 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 23 45
step = 4; 
key = 23
s1: 0 -> 4
s2: 4 -> 8
s3: arr[8] larger than key, so we use linear search 
from index 4 to 8

linear search < jump search < binary search
