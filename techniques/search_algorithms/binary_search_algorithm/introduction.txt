first at all, sort this array, then focus on compare value, dividing to
two parts, compare with middle element, if larger than mid, choose
right parts, and do it again, loop, similar with smaller than

1 3 5 7 10 12 35 234 : find 35
length = 8
mid = 4
arr[4] < 35 => length = 4
mid = 4+2
arr[mid] = 35 => return mid = 6

complexity to O(log N)
