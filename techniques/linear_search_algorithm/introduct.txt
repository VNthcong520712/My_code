each elemet was compared with the key, if this is correct answer, the result return its index, else if wrong answer, index is added one and continue loop.

ex: arr[] = {1,6,2,4,2,6,7,2,6,0,8,9} key = 4
(arr[0] == 4)? => false
(arr[1] == 4)? => false
(arr[2] == 4)? => false
(arr[3] == 4)? => true => return 3 and break loop

O(N) with N is the size

not good for large arrays
