Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that
works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements
if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is
not suitable for large data sets as its average
and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

ex: arr{1,7,2,3,9,4}
low2high:
pseudocode:

for i run from 0 -> end:
	for j rum from 0 -> end - i - 1:
		if arr[j+1] > arr[j]:
			swap

1st: 1 2 3 7 4 9
2nd: 1 2 3 4 7 9
3rd: 1 2 3 4 7 9
