Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting 
algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the 
smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted 
portion of the list and moving it to the sorted 
portion of the list. 

ex: {4,2,7,3,8,2,3,0}

pseudocode:

for i in range(0, end-1):
	for j in range(i+1, end):
		find min of did range
	swap arr[i] with arr[min]

1st: 0 2 7 3 8 2 3 4
2nd: 0 2 7 3 8 2 3 4
3rd: 0 2 2 3 8 7 3 4
4th: 0 2 2 3 8 7 3 4
5th: 0 2 2 3 3 7 8 4
6th: 0 2 2 3 3 4 8 7 
7th: 0 2 2 3 3 4 7 8
8th: 0 2 2 3 3 4 7 8
